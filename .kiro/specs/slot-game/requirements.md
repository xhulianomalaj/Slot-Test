# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a fully functional slot machine game using PixiJS v8 and TypeScript. The game will be rendered entirely on HTML5 Canvas using PixiJS for graphics, animations, and interactions. The slot game will include classic slot machine mechanics with spinning reels, symbol matching, win calculations, and engaging visual and audio feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a visually appealing slot machine interface, so that I can enjoy an immersive gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a betting interface with spin button and balance display
3. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL render all graphics using PixiJS on a full canvas interface
4. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display appropriate slot machine UI elements (paylines, bet controls, win display)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to spin the reels and see animated results, so that I can play the slot game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the spin button THEN the system SHALL animate all 5 reels spinning downward
2. WHEN the reels are spinning THEN the system SHALL disable the spin button to prevent multiple spins
3. WHEN the reels stop spinning THEN the system SHALL display the final symbol combination
4. WHEN the reels stop THEN the system SHALL enable the spin button for the next spin
5. WHEN reels are spinning THEN the system SHALL play appropriate sound effects using pixi-sound

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to calculate and display my winnings, so that I know when I've won and how much.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reels stop spinning THEN the system SHALL evaluate all active paylines for winning combinations
2. WHEN a winning combination is found THEN the system SHALL highlight the winning symbols and payline
3. WHEN a win occurs THEN the system SHALL calculate the win amount based on symbol values and bet amount
4. WHEN a win occurs THEN the system SHALL update the player's balance with the winnings
5. WHEN a win occurs THEN the system SHALL display the win amount with animated text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control my betting options, so that I can manage my gameplay strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with bet controls THEN the system SHALL allow me to adjust my bet per line
2. WHEN I adjust my bet THEN the system SHALL update the total bet display
3. WHEN I adjust my bet THEN the system SHALL ensure the bet doesn't exceed my available balance
4. WHEN my balance is insufficient THEN the system SHALL disable the spin button
5. WHEN I spin THEN the system SHALL deduct the total bet amount from my balance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth animations and responsive interactions, so that the game feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any animation plays THEN the system SHALL use GSAP for smooth, performant animations
2. WHEN I interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN symbols land on reels THEN the system SHALL animate them with bounce or scale effects
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly using the XState finite state machine
5. WHEN animations are playing THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want audio feedback during gameplay, so that the experience is more immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the spin button THEN the system SHALL play a spin sound effect
2. WHEN reels are spinning THEN the system SHALL play a continuous reel spinning sound
3. WHEN reels stop THEN the system SHALL play a reel stop sound for each reel
4. WHEN I win THEN the system SHALL play a win celebration sound
5. WHEN I interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL play appropriate click/hover sounds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to be built with modern TypeScript and proper state management, so that the code is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for all game logic and type safety
2. WHEN game states change THEN the system SHALL use XState v5 for predictable state management
3. WHEN the project is developed THEN the system SHALL use Vite for fast development and building
4. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL use only PixiJS v8 for all rendering without additional UI frameworks
5. WHEN the code is written THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices and proper typing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-organized and maintainable, so that the project remains scalable and easy to work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are created THEN the system SHALL organize all files in logically structured folders that reflect their purpose and functionality
2. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL ensure no single file exceeds 600-650 lines to maintain readability and modularity
3. WHEN components are implemented THEN the system SHALL separate concerns appropriately (core, components, config, logic, state, utils)
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL place files in the correct folder structure following established patterns
5. WHEN files grow too large THEN the system SHALL refactor them into smaller, focused modules
